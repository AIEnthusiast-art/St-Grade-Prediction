## 🛠 Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pip or conda
- Virtual environment recommended

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grade-prediction-app.git
    cd grade-prediction-app
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    Linux/MacOS:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the app:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

Open your browser at http://localhost:8000 (if FastAPI) or the interface provided.

###🎯 Usage
Input student data manually or upload a CSV.

Click Predict to get the predicted grades.

Visualize predictions via interactive charts.

Download the results for record-keeping.

###🧠 How It Works
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature selection based on academic relevance

Model training using regression/classification algorithms

Prediction generation for new or existing student data

Display results with visualization

Machine Learning models used: Random Forest, Linear Regression, or XGBoost (depending on dataset).


###💻 Technologies Used
